"""A hung test has to die and name itself, not hold the merge queue for six hours.

Nothing in this suite blocks on a thread, a socket or a child process, but the
gate it runs in is the family's, and the family has tests that do. A required
check with no clock on it stalls until GitHub's own six-hour job limit and
prints nothing that says which test stopped -- so the budget lives here, where
removing it goes red rather than quiet.

Both numbers are ceilings, not targets: the per-test budget clears this suite's
slowest test many times over, and the job budget is about three times a green
run. They bite on a hang and on nothing else.
